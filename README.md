## Description
The current target for this game is to make it so that we can have two players (baby yodas) shooting at each other. We will have weapons to pick up and a system to keep the score counter for each player.

## Current Functionality
The player is currently able to walk around, look, jump, run, and crouch.
Half of a door is functioning, where it can open by walking into a collider.

## Goals for each person
- Matteo: Finish / further develop the map
- Kimo: Multiplayer lobby and controls
